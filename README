Run (org-generated) HTML into a neat site according to my taste.
Used for http://fwwm.us/. 

So this app turns this:

    https://github.com/progo/fwwmus---org               [1]

into this:

    https://github.com/progo/fwwm.us/tree/gh-pages      [2]

(Help is given by scripts in root of [1] and of course the org 
configuration of mine in .emacs.)
